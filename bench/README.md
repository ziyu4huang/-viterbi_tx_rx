ModelSim is a commercial software and typically requires a paid license. However, there may be limited versions or trial versions available for free, such as ModelSim PE Student Edition. Check the official website for specific details and availability.


The `run_sim` file is a script used for running simulations in the ModelSim simulation environment. Here are the details of each line in the script:

1. `vlib work`:
   - This command creates a new library named `work`. In ModelSim, libraries are directories that contain compiled design units.

2. `vlog ../rtl/*.v`:
   - This command compiles all Verilog source files located in the `../rtl` directory. The `*.v` wildcard matches all files with a `.v` extension.

3. `vlog ../bench/*.v`:
   - This command compiles all Verilog testbench files located in the `../bench` directory. Similar to the previous command, the `*.v` wildcard matches all files with a `.v` extension.

4. `vsim -c -novopt mac_test -do sim.do`:
   - This command runs the simulation in command-line mode (`-c`) without optimization (`-novopt`). 
   - `mac_test` is the top-level module or testbench to simulate.
   - The `-do sim.do` argument specifies a DO file named `sim.do` that contains a list of commands to be executed during the simulation.

In summary, this script sets up the simulation environment, compiles the necessary Verilog source and testbench files, and then runs the simulation using ModelSim.
